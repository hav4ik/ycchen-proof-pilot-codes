# OPD v2 — her V33 production config (run_agentic_mn_32b.sbatch) + the two cu128/B200 deltas.
# Faithful to her best OPD-32B run. Source before run_mn_cu128.sh inside a >=8-node slurm allocation:
#   source /opt/opd/launch/env_v33_b200.sh && bash /opt/opd/launch/run_mn_cu128.sh
#
# REQUIRED (cluster paths): STUDENT_PATH, STUDENT_DEPLOY_PATH, ROLLOUT_MODEL, DEEPSEEK_V4_FLASH, RUN_DIR (shared FS).
# The student deploy dir works for BOTH trainer and rollout (transformers reconstructs rope_parameters
# from the legacy rope_scaling; sglang needs the legacy form) — so STUDENT_PATH may equal ROLLOUT_MODEL.

# B200 MoE backend (REQUIRED on sm_100 — validated 2026-07-13 on 4xB200 TP4, clean Euclid proof).
# DeepSeek-V4-Flash stores its EXPERTS IN FP4 (only attn/router/dense are fp8). On Blackwell `auto`
# mis-resolves to the fp8 triton MoE runner, which CRASHES ("Hidden size mismatch"); deep_gemm
# (swiglu_limit/JIT-EP shape guard) and flashinfer_trtllm (format_is_bypassed) also fail — all are
# fp8 expert runners vs fp4-packed weights (fp8 MoE for V4 is unsupported by design, sglang #25704/#23743).
# flashinfer_mxfp4 is the fp4-NATIVE Blackwell path — SAME precision as her Hopper marlin fp4 experts,
# NOT a downgrade. First launch does a one-time ~15min flashinfer fp4 autotune (looks frozen between
# ~2:18 profiles — it's warming, not hung); persisted via JIT_CACHE_DIR. NVFP4 support (#25820) is
# already in 0.5.14 — no sglang bump needed.
# MoE backend is AUTO-DETECTED in run_teacher.sh (compute_cap major==10 = Blackwell sm_10x = B200/B300 ->
# flashinfer_mxfp4; else auto -> marlin on Hopper). So this env does NOT set MOE_BACKEND, and a b300 wrapper
# that sources this stays thin. Force a specific one with:  export MOE_BACKEND=<backend>
